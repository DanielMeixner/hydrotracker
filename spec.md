# Hydro Tracker Functional Spec

## Core Features

### Water Intake Input
- Users can quickly log water intake using predefined buttons:
  - "Glass"
  - "Half glass"
  - "Bottle"
- There is also an optional custom amount input (number field), but the main focus is on the quick buttons.
- Logging is a single click/tap actionâ€”no typing required for the main options.

### Daily Tracking & Threshold
- The app tracks the total amount of water consumed each day.
- A daily threshold (user-defined or default) is visually indicated:
  - The total for the day is displayed in red until the threshold is reached.
  - Once the threshold is reached, the display turns green.

### History & Visualization
- A daily bar chart shows water intake for the last 10 days.
- Users can navigate to previous 10-day periods to view older data.
