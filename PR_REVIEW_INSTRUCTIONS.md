## Code Review Checklist

### 1. State Management Review
- [ ] **StateContext Changes**: Review demo mode state structure and actions
  - Verify `isDemo` boolean flag is properly integrated
  - Check demo data structure (7 days of realistic intake data)
  - Confirm `ENTER_DEMO` and `EXIT_DEMO` actions work correctly
  - Validate localStorage write prevention logic

- [ ] **Sample Data Quality**: Verify demo data is realistic
  - Daily totals range from 750ml to 1750ml
  - Individual entries use common amounts (200ml, 300ml, etc.)
  - Spread across 7 days with reasonable variation

### 2. UI/UX Review
- [ ] **Demo Mode Indicator**: Review visual design and functionality
  - Orange gradient banner with clear messaging
  - "ðŸŽ¯ DEMO MODE" badge and explanatory text
  - Properly styled "Exit Demo" button
  - Responsive design for mobile devices

- [ ] **Demo Mode Controls**: Check activation/deactivation UI
  - "Try Demo" button appears in normal mode
  - Controls switch properly between states
  - Status messages include "(demo mode)" when appropriate

### 3. Functionality Testing

#### 3.1 Quick Smoke Test
1. **Start Development Server**:
   ```bash
   cd implementation && npm start
   ```

2. **Basic Demo Mode Test**:
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`
   - Click "Try Demo" button
   - Verify demo banner appears and data changes
   - Add some water intake, change threshold
   - Click "Exit Demo" and verify return to normal state

3. **URL Parameter Test**:
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/?demo=true`
   - Verify demo mode auto-activates
   - Test exit functionality

#### 3.2 Automated Test Verification
1. **Run All Tests**:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
   - Should show 27 tests passing
   - No failing tests or errors

2. **Test Categories to Verify**:
   - [ ] `App.test.tsx` - 3 tests passing (basic app functionality)
   - [ ] `DemoMode.test.tsx` - 9 tests passing (integration workflows)
   - [ ] `DemoModeIndicator.test.tsx` - 8 tests passing (UI component)
   - [ ] `StateContext.test.tsx` - 7 tests passing (state management)

#### 3.3 Build Verification
1. **Production Build**:
   ```bash
   cd implementation && npm run build
   ```
   - Should complete without errors
   - No TypeScript compilation issues

### 4. Code Quality Review

#### 4.1 TypeScript and Code Style
- [ ] **Type Safety**: All new code properly typed
- [ ] **Code Style**: Consistent with existing codebase
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Proper error boundaries and fallbacks
- [ ] **Performance**: No unnecessary re-renders or memory leaks

#### 4.2 Accessibility Review
- [ ] **ARIA Attributes**: Demo mode indicator has `aria-live="polite"`
- [ ] **Keyboard Navigation**: All demo controls are keyboard accessible
- [ ] **Screen Reader**: Demo mode status is announced to screen readers
- [ ] **Focus Management**: Proper focus indicators on interactive elements

### 5. Test Coverage Review

#### 5.1 Unit Test Coverage
- [ ] **State Management**: 
  - `ENTER_DEMO` and `EXIT_DEMO` actions
  - Demo data loading and structure
  - localStorage write prevention
  - Data integrity verification

#### 5.2 Integration Test Coverage  
- [ ] **User Workflows**:
  - Demo mode activation via UI button
  - Demo mode exit and data restoration
  - Write prevention during demo mode
  - Navigation with demo data

#### 5.3 Component Test Coverage
- [ ] **UI Components**:
  - Demo mode indicator visibility states
  - Button click handlers and callbacks
  - Styling and CSS class verification
  - Accessibility attributes

### 6. Manual Testing Verification

Review the manual testing documentation and spot-check key scenarios:

#### 6.1 Critical Path Testing
- [ ] **Demo Activation**: Both URL and UI button methods work
- [ ] **Data Integrity**: Demo data doesn't overwrite real user data
- [ ] **Write Prevention**: localStorage isn't modified in demo mode
- [ ] **Visual Indicators**: Demo mode is clearly identifiable

#### 6.2 Edge Case Testing
- [ ] **Empty State**: Demo mode works without existing user data
- [ ] **Rapid Toggling**: Multiple activation/deactivation cycles
- [ ] **Browser Refresh**: Demo mode behavior on page reload
- [ ] **Mobile Responsiveness**: Demo indicator adapts to small screens

### 7. Documentation Review

- [ ] **README Updates**: Testing procedures are clear and complete
- [ ] **Manual Testing Guide**: Comprehensive and easy to follow
- [ ] **Code Comments**: Complex logic is properly documented
- [ ] **PR Description**: Accurately reflects changes and testing status

## Approval Criteria

This PR should be approved when:

1. âœ… All automated tests pass (27/27)
2. âœ… Production build completes successfully  
3. âœ… Manual smoke testing shows core functionality works
4. âœ… Demo mode visual indicators are clear and professional
5. âœ… Write prevention successfully protects user data
6. âœ… Demo mode can be activated and deactivated reliably
7. âœ… Code follows project standards and is properly typed
8. âœ… Documentation is comprehensive and accurate

## Common Issues to Watch For

- **localStorage Conflicts**: Ensure demo mode truly prevents writes
- **State Leakage**: Verify demo data doesn't persist after exit
- **UI Glitches**: Check for visual artifacts or layout issues
- **Test Flakiness**: Ensure tests are reliable and deterministic
- **TypeScript Errors**: All types should be properly defined
- **Mobile Compatibility**: Demo indicators should work on small screens

## Post-Merge Verification

After merging, verify:
1. Demo mode works in deployed environment
2. No regression in existing functionality  
3. Performance impact is minimal
4. Manual testing procedures are followed by QA team
