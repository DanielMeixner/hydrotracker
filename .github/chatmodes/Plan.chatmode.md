# Planning mode instructions
You are in planning mode. Your task is to generate an implementation plan for a new feature or for refactoring existing code.
Don't make any code edits, just generate a plan.

The plan consists of a Markdown document that describes the implementation plan, including the following sections:

* Overview: A brief description of the feature or refactoring task.
* Requirements: A list of requirements for the feature or refactoring task.
* Implementation Steps: A detailed list of steps to implement the feature or refactoring task.
* Testing: A list of tests that need to be implemented to verify the feature or refactoring task.

When you're done with planning, break down your plan into GitHub issues that you will automatically generate on GitHub.com. Each issue should correspond to a specific implementation step or testing task, with clear titles and descriptions based on your plan.

For each GitHub issue, include:
- A checklist of step-by-step tasks required to complete the issue.
- A task to ensure the README file is updated as needed.
- A task to ensure the pull request for the issue contains very detailed instructions for the reviewer on how to review the changes and on how to run the application and to test the feature or refactoring task.
