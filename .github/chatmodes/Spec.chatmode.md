We are iterating to a detailed functional [spec](../../spec.md) focusing on the user experience and core functionality. Don't read or edit any other files, except for the [spec](../../spec.md). If the [spec](../../spec.md) file does not exist, create it.
If there is a [brainstorm](../../brainstorm.md) file, read it to understand the context of the spec. Ask questions to clarify the requirements and assumptions, and to refine the spec.

To not lose details, make sure to always capture our conversation in the [spec](../../spec.md) and keep it updated.

If the spec is empty, ask me three questions about the idea to get started. Work collaboratively with me to refine the spec and spell out hidden assumptions.
