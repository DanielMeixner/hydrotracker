# Implementation Plan: Hydro Tracker

## Overview

Hydro Tracker is a simple web application for tracking daily water intake. Users can quickly log water consumption using predefined buttons or a custom input, view their daily progress against a threshold, and see a historical bar chart of their intake for the last 10 days (with navigation for previous periods).

## Requirements

- Simple, responsive web interface.
- Predefined buttons for common water amounts ("Glass", "Half glass", "Bottle").
- Optional custom amount input.
- One-click/tap logging for water intake.
- Daily tracking of total water consumed.
- Visual threshold indicator (red before reaching, green after reaching).
- Daily bar chart for the last 10 days, with navigation for previous periods.
- Persistent storage of water intake data (local storage or backend).
- User-defined or default daily threshold.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Project Setup**
   - Initialize a new web project (e.g., React, Vue, or plain HTML/JS).
   - Set up version control (Git).
   - Configure basic project structure (components, styles, assets).

2. **UI Design**
   - Design the main interface with:
     - Predefined buttons for "Glass", "Half glass", "Bottle".
     - Custom amount input field.
     - "Add" button for logging intake.
     - Display for today’s total and threshold indicator.
     - Bar chart area for history.
     - Navigation controls for history (previous/next 10 days).

3. **State Management**
   - Define state for:
     - Today's water intake.
     - Historical intake data.
     - Current threshold.
     - Current 10-day window for history view.

4. **Water Intake Logging**
   - Implement logic for logging intake via buttons and custom input.
   - Update today’s total and historical data on each log.

5. **Threshold Indicator**
   - Implement logic to compare today’s total to the threshold.
   - Change display color (red/green) based on threshold status.

6. **History & Visualization**
   - Implement a bar chart to display the last 10 days of intake.
   - Add navigation to view previous/next 10-day periods.
   - Ensure chart updates as new data is logged.

7. **Persistence**
   - Store water intake data and threshold in local storage (or backend if required).
   - Load data on app start and update as needed.

8. **Threshold Customization**
   - Allow user to set a custom daily threshold (with a default value).

9. **Styling & Responsiveness**
   - Apply simple, clean, and responsive styles for usability on desktop and mobile.

10. **Accessibility & UX**
    - Ensure buttons and inputs are accessible.
    - Provide feedback for actions (e.g., confirmation on log).

## Testing

- Unit tests for:
  - Intake logging logic.
  - Threshold calculation and color change.
  - Data persistence and retrieval.
  - Bar chart data generation and navigation.
- UI/UX tests:
  - Button and input accessibility.
  - Responsive layout on different devices.
- Manual testing:
  - Logging various amounts.
  - Navigating history.
  - Setting and changing thresholds.
  - Data persistence across reloads.
